# Breast_Cancer_Classification

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms called Artificial Neural Networks, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. This 
repository contains a predictive model that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on thirty medical parameters that are input. The dataset that has been used to train and test the model is the Scikit-Learn breast cancer dataset. The Keras Sequential model has been used.

One can find details about the Sequential Model via the following link :

The accuracy of the model on the test data is around 98.246%. It may be noted that the use of Neural Networks provide better accuracy and results than using classification algorithms like logistic regression and so on.
